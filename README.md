# ParSeMiS Python Wrapper

This script is a wrapper for the frequent subgraph mining library ParSeMiS.

# Instructions

The script includes a class called Parsemis, which you can pass the same
parameters too if you were using ParSeMiS on the command line. The input
for the graph method are graphs built using NetworkX. 


# Requriements

* **NetworkX**

We use NetworkX due to it's large number of input formats that it can
read and write to.

See: http://networkx.readthedocs.io/en/networkx-1.11/reference/readwrite.html
